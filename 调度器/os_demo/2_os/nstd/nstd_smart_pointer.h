/** @struct obj_ptr
  * @brief Smart pointer type to hold object on heap, it can delete object
  * automaticly when its destructor is called. This is a kind of single
  * owner smart pointer, which means that copy between obj_ptr is not
  * allow, but you are allow to transfer ownership between obj_ptr. The
  * obj_ptr owns the object pointed by it, and automaticly cleans the
  * object when the obj_ptr goes out of scope.
  * @param Type the type of object that is pointed by the smart pointer.
  * @param delete_policy When the obj_ptr is out of scope, the destructor
  * of the obj_ptr will be calld, and it behaves like the following
  * @code
  * ~obj_ptr(){
  * delete_policy::delete_object_policy(c_ptr).
  * }
  * @endcode
  * Normally, if you are using default_delete_policy<Type>, then the
  * delete_object_policy behaves like the following
  * @code
  * delete_object_policy(Type* c_ptr){
  *     delete c_ptr;
  * }
  * @endcode However, if your Type has a member function defined as
  * @code
  * virtual bool smpi_is_heap_obj()
  * @endcode
  * Then the delete_object_policy behaves like the following:
  * @code
  * delete_object_policy(Type* c_ptr){
  *     // the query function may be virtual, we cannot call an object's
  *     // virtual member function with a null pointer
  *     if((c_ptr!=0)&&(c_ptr->api_fun_name())){
  *         delete c_ptr;   // delete it only it is on the heap
  *     }
  * }
  * @endcode
  * If smpi_is_heap_obj() returns true, then c_ptr will be deleted in
  * delete_object_policy. Otherwise the delete_object_policy will do
  * nothing to the pointer. This is used in situations, say, some gui
  * system require some kind of resource with certain interface (virtual
  * functions), and the GUI system use smart pointer to automaticly
  * manage the resource object. If the interface defines a virtual
  * function (usually pure virtual):
  * @code
  * class font_interface{
  * public:
  *     virtual char* get_dot_matrix(char character);
  *     ...
  *
  *     virtual smpi_is_heap_obj() = 0;
  * }
  * @endcode
  * Then your user-defined font object, which you want to be selected
  * into the gui system, doesn't have to be created on the heap.
  * You can inherit the interface and implement your own
  * smpi_is_heap_obj, returns the correct answer and then the system
  * will work pretty well with the smart pointer! Note that you may
  * have to add additional data member and changge its constructor
  * function interface to ensure that the object knows where he is
  * and smpi_is_heap_obj returns the correct answer. Sometimes you
  * are pretty sure that your user-defined class object would never be
  * created on the heap, you can just return false in the
  * smpi_is_heap_obj in this case. The requirement is that you must
  * return the correct answer in the virtual smpi_is_heap_obj() function
  * if you defined it. Besides, if you defined it, you must make sure
  * that any derived class define this virtual method and return the
  * correct answer.
  * @note Object of this type <b> CANNOT RETURN BY ANY FUNCTION </b>.
